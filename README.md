# WASM Fuzzing Study Artifacts

This is an artifact repository for the paper titled **Left Behind, Not Forgotten: Reusing Regression Tests to Find Bugs in WebAssembly Runtimes**.

This paper reports on a large-scale study to assess the benefits of using regression tests to find bugs in WASM runtimes. The study explores two scenarios of use of regression tests: (1) transplanting such tests across runtimes and (2) using such tests as seed corpora for fuzzing.

Our mined seed corpora `rtbench` (acronym for *Regression Test Bench*) is shared in this repository's release artifacts. ([Link]()).
